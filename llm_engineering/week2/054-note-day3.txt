Structure of prompt messages to OpenAI:

```
[
    {"role": "system", "content": "system message here"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "first user prompt here"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "the assistant's response"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "the new user prompt"},
]
```

We will write a function `chat(message, history)` where:  
**message** is the prompt to use  
**history** is the past conversation, in OpenAI format

Maybe adding some "prompts" for system when "some-word", being relevant, appears.
