      "MatchAnything is a strong universal image matching model, pre-trained on a large scale involving different imaging modalities. This allows it to exhibit remarkable generalizability on unseen multi-modality matching and registration tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image matching has many applications, like image stitching (think about the \"panorama\" feature in your phone), merging satellite images to be displayed on\n",
      "Google\n",
      "Earth or Street View, stichting together medical images from a scan, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key contribution of the MatchAnything paper is the pre-training framework. The authors collect a massive, diverse dataset synthesized with cross-modal stimulus signals. This includes multi-view images with 3D reconstructions, large-scale unlabelled video sequences, and vast single-image datasets. Furthermore, synthetic data is used via image generation techniques (like style transfer and depth estimation). Collecting such diverse data teaches the model to recognize fundamental, appearance-insensitive structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors applied their framework to train 2 popular image matching models: EfficientLofTR and ROMA. EfficientLofTR was recently integrated in the Transformers library, hence the weights which the MatchAnything authors released are now available.\n",

      "FAIR, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is the natural evolution of the first SAM: extending promptable segmentation from static images into the video domain. With its streaming memory architecture, SAM2 can track and refine object masks across long videos in real time, making it one of the most powerful models for interactive and automatic video segmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model builds a memory bank of past frames and prompts, encoding both spatial features and compact “object pointer” tokens that summarize the target. Each new frame is then processed in relation to this memory through attention, letting SAM2 recall what the object looked like and where it was last observed. Combined with an explicit occlusion prediction head, this design allows SAM2 to keep track of objects robustly and to recover them with minimal user input after partial or full occlusion.\n",
